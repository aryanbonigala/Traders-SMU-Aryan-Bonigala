## 1. Background in Quantitative Finance

I am currently doing Math 1340 which is both calculus one and two. I am working toward a degree in both math and finance. I took one computer science course in high school but that was in 9th or 10th grade. I have some basic trading experience through fundamental and technical analysis. I am currently only paper trading to refine a new trading process and getting used to making my own scanners. My interest in quantitative finance was sparked when I learned that you could essentially automate trading by building algorithms that would eliminate any emotional response you had to a trade and work solely on data. 

## 2. Career Goals

The role or position that interests me the most is quantitative trader. However I would like to be combine all the roles if possible. I would love to work for Renaissance Tech. Other than Renaissance Tech, I would like to work at either Jane Street or Jump Trading. I would like to work for either a hedge fund or prop firm. In one year I would like to have an internship and any quant firm (summer of 2026). In 5 years I would like to work at Jane Street. In 10 years I would like to be working at Renaissance Tech. 

## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program

In this program I want to learn the fundamentals of coding in Python and C++ so that I can code my own algorithm. I would also like to learn more about trading strategies outside of technical and fundamental analysis as well as learn how to implement them more efficiently. I would also like a brief introduction into the math needed as I will need to learn this math for my major. I need to learn asset pricing, risk management, portfolio optimization, and derivatives. I also need to learn statistical arbitrage, trend-following, and high-frequency trading. I also think I need to be familiar with QuantConnect for frequent backtesting so that would be beneficial to learn. 

## 4. Current Technical Skills

In programming I would rate myself as a beginner. In data analysis tools I would rate myself as a beginner. In statistical analysis I would rate myself as a beginner. In financial modeling I would rate myself as a beginner. In machine learning I would rate myself as a beginner. In version control I would rate myself intermediate. 

## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals

I plan on developing programming skills in Python and C++ and use libraries like TensorFlow for machine learning. I will also learn how to use Bloomberg terminal. Another thing to add on to that is skills in portfolio optimization, risk management strategies, and implementing algorithmic trading models. I will be taking time on my own to learn more advanced math that is required for quant. I will be able to track my process through the weekly assignments, certification as well as personal projects. I am planning on spending 10-15 hours a week for the program. I will probably obtain a CQF certification either this semester or over the summer. By the end of this semester I want to be able to make my own profitable algorithm that I can deploy on real money. 

*I understand that this document will be used to track my progress throughout the program and may be referenced during career counseling sessions. I commit to working toward these goals during the Traders@SMU Alpha Program.*
